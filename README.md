# Python---Secure-Chatting-Project
This project is focused on reliable chatting server-client system, more specifically on implementing the two-dimentional parity algorithm used to provide service of reliable-messaging.

The project was inspired by Chapter 5 - Error-Correcting Codes: Mistakes That Fix Themselves from the book Nine Algorithms that Changed the Future by MacCormick, 2012 edition. In this chapter, the parity algorithm is described in detail, however, without any implementation, so I decided to implement it.
